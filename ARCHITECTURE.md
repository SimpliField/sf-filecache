## File cache

This repository uses `Knifecycle` to declare the service so that
 you can safely use it with any DI system.

[See in context](./src/index.js#L14-L18)



### Path

To ensure the key will be compatible with the File System, we need
 to clean it up.

[See in context](./src/index.js#L319-L323)



### Header

The header allows to store the cache end of life along
 with the cached buffer so that we do not need to store
 extra contents elsewhere.
